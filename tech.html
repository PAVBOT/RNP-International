            <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">Rep. Ritchie Torres criticized New York Governor Kathy Hochul for hesitating on legislation to ban public mask-wearing intended to curb hate-driven actions. This comes after anti-Israel protesters, wearing keffiyeh, took control of a Barnard College building. Torres argued that legislation restricting masks is needed to prevent harassment and uphold civil rights. He emphasized that a mask ban has historical precedent in combating the Ku Klux Klan and encouraged the Governor to implement decisive measures. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>
